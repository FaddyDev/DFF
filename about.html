        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every successful business started just as an idea.</span></p>
        
        <p><em>DFF IT Solutions</em> started as an idea, just like any other business, in 2016. The idea was brought up by the fact that IT has been the backbone of <b>every</b> business today and will continue to be even in the days to come. That's when three friends with experience in the field of information technology sat down and planned what is to be a solution to the business and management problems and issues in Central Kenya and beyond.</p>
        
        <p>The members are David Mbochi Wandati, Makokha Fredrick Barasa and Francis Kimwaki. Other temporary members exist, forming a large body of programmers, technicians and consultants. We are located in Nyeri town, Nyeri County, Kenya. All members are either working in the field of or study information technology and have work experience in the IT sector.</p>
        
        <p>We have no parmanent location since we mostly deal with soft jobs. One can say we have an online office. We receive requests from you, our esteemed customers, then we work on them and show the progress from time to time. For instance, if you want a website, we can either be sending the complete modules from time to me or we come in person and show you the progress. We also visit schools, businesses, organisations and individuals (like bloggers), telling them the importance of websites and blog sites to them and also finding out other issues that we can solve through technology.</p>
       
       <h3>Our Mission</h3>
	   <p>To help boost the performance of businesses and schools, minimize costs and increase income and productivity by offering a tool for information sharing and management.</p>
	   <h3>Our Vission</h3>
	   <p>To be the leading provider of IT solutions in the country and beyond.</p>
